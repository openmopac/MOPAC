*
* In this test:
*
* (A) There are four breaks, indicated by the four of the "TER" lines in the PDB data-set. 
*     These breaks must be preserved in the new PDB file. 
*     A "TER" normally means that there is a break before the next atom.
*
*     In two instances a "TER" has been put inside a ligand - these are ignored.
*
* (B) The atoms are re-sequenced to put them into the standard PDB sequence.
*
* (C) The residue sequence and chain letter are changed.
*
* (D) A residue, mis-labeled as "XXX" is (correctly) re-labeled as "PRO"
*
*
